# responsive-portfolio-homework

For this assignment, I updated my existing mobile responsive portfolio I submitted in November using Bootstrap's components and grid system.  I edited the Portfolio page by adding 3 example projects/homework assignments I completed.  I updated my resume, converted it to pdf format and added links to them on my portfolio.  I also updated my Github and LinkedIn profiles and included links to them as well.  In my previous submission, I wasnt totally satisfied with the color palette and some of the layout, so I updated those as well. The link to the updated Portfolio is below.
