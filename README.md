# responsive-portfolio-homework

For this assignment, I created a mobile responsive portfolio using Bootstrap's components and grid system.
The site has a consistant nav bar with functioning links, a responsive layout and images, and uses semantic HTML
to allow accessibility. Once my coding was complete, I used an HTML validation service to make sure it was correct.  
Please see below for screenshots and a link to the fully-functioning deployed website.
